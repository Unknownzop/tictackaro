## 🛠️ How It Works

The game uses DOM manipulation and event listeners to track player moves, check for wins or draws, and update the UI accordingly. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Game Board**: 3×3 grid of clickable cells
- **Turn Logic**: Alternates between X and O
- **Win Detection**: Checks predefined winning combinations
- **Draw Detection**: Checks if all cells are filled without a winner
- **Modal Display**: Shows result and options to restart or quit
